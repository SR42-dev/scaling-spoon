Hey guys, for your ROS assignments, you have the following tasks to do:
1) Create your own publisher and subscriber files, with at least two publishers and two subscribers, name them broadcaster and receiver, and email them along with a screenshot of your output.
2) Use the turtlesim_cleaner.py to develop a node that makes the turtlesim move in a specific shap such as a rectangle. The more complex the shape the better. Email the code file as well as the output screenshot.
3) Finally, develop a go_to_goal function that makes the turtle move from the current position to (2,2,2). You need to use a P controller at minimum, but ideally, use a PID controller for maximum marks. Send the code along with a video of the turtle moving. Refer to turtlesim_cleaner.py for the P controller. The following links will aid you in developing a PID controller:
